morea_summary: "The logic gates covered in this summary are Not, And, Or, Nand, Nor, Xor, and Xnor. Multiple, combined logic gates can be used to create any given circuit. Each logic gate has its own, unique truth table, circuit symbol, and logic function in Boolean algebra. The standard logic gate has 1-2 inputs and one output but logic gates can have multiple inputs."

### Textbook summary
The logic gates covered in this summary are Not, And, Or, Nand, Nor, Xor, and Xnor. Multiple, combined logic gates can be used to create any given circuit. Each logic gate has its own, unique truth table, circuit symbol, and logic function in Boolean algebra. The standard logic gate has 1-2 inputs and one output but logic gates can have multiple inputs.
