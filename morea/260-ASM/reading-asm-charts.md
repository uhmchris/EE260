morea_summary: "ASM Charts are another way to visualize finite state machines. Each ASM design is created using either the Mealy or Moore method. An ASM is a chart that will guide states based on inputs. It works the same as state diagrams, so either one can be used interchangably, it is usually preference."

# Textbook Summary
* Algorithmic State Machines (ASM charts)
  * ASM Charts are another way of describing FSMs
  * ASMs effectively work the same way as state diagrams, so typically it is user's preference on which design they would rather use.
  * ASMs differ by using squares as states or output signals, diamonds to represent an input, and sometimes an oval to represent an output.
  * These will also have the types Moore and Mealy.

  Notice that the output is in an oval, this is usually a quick way to know that it is a Mealy Machine.
